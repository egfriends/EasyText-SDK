EasyText is a free app helping ease the text input on your iOS device.

If you are app developer and want to integrate EasyText to your app: Download the SDK and Sample Project to integrate EasyText into your app, it's really that easy to add this magic to your app. I promise.

To integrate EasyText, you need to 
1. copy EasyTextSniffer.h, EasyTextSniffer.m and sniff.wav files to your app
2. import EasyTextSniffer.h file where you need it
3. call "sniffer = [EasyTextSniffer new];" before you create your UITextView instance; Note that EasyText also support UITextField.
4. call "sniffer sniffTextView:YourUITextViewInstance delegate:self];"
5. call "sniffer.caseInsensitive = (BOOL)UserSetting;"
6. call "sniffer.noSound = (BOOL)UserSetting;"
7. don't forget "[sniffer release];" in the dealloc method

You can turn on or turn off EasyText integrated features by calling following two methods:
	[sniffer tryEnable]; // this method is to turn on EasyText features. If EasyText app is not installed in user's device, a UIAlertView will be shown.
	[sniffer disable]; // and this method is to turn it off.
the practical way to do this is, like in the sample project, make a button or other mechanism to let user turn it on or off. You can get a BOOL value indicating if sniffer is enabled by calling sniffer.enabled.
