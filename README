If you are app developer and want to integrate EasyText to your app: Download the SDK and Sample Project to integrate EasyText into your app, it's really that easy to add this magic to your app. I promise.

To integrate EasyText, you need to 
1. copy EasyTextSniffer.h, EasyTextSniffer.m and sniff.wav files to your app
2. import EasyTextSniffer.h file where you need it
3. call "sniffer = [EasyTextSniffer new];" before you create your UITextView instance
4. call "sniffer sniffTextView:YourUITextViewInstance delegate:self];"
5. call "sniffer.caseInsensitive = (BOOL)UserSetting;"
6. call "sniffer.noSound = (BOOL)UserSetting;"
7. don't forget "[sniffer release];" in the dealloc method
