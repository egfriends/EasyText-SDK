EasyText is a free app helping ease the text input on your iOS device. 

EasyText will save you a lot of time from typing duplicated text like "I love my Angry Captain Game" or "This is my facebook name: xxx". All you need to do is set abbreviations for those texts, and input the abbreviations instead of the real ones, and Magic happens! 

You can also share your compose to Mail, SMS or copy to other apps, or you can share it right on twitter, facebook or tumblr. 

If you choose to use advanced features, you can set abbreviations for amazing text pics like bunnies, bears and foods, or just click one to show in writing pad. See:

***** 

EasyText supports external access to the abbreviations and snippets you have set in this app. So if you want to use the magic power of EasyText in your other favorite apps like Twitter or Facebook, just drop the developer of your favorite app a line that he can add the magic in his app. I think he/she will listen to you.
